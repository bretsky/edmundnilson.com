	                        <br>
	                        &emsp;&emsp;Nilsonian government is the principle of governing a nation based on the ideas of the renowned, revolutionary Canadian-American political scientist and philosopher Edmund Nilson (1999-2098). His comprehensive knowledge was published in his “manual of politics”, as described by James Conway, director of Political Science at the Independent University of Canada, <span class="cite">The Internal Systems of Government and Statecraft</span>. This book comprised of 14 sections on Nilson's ideal form of government: the meritocratic democracy. Many of our modern governments today base their system of government and succession on this model provided by Nilson. 
	                        <br><br>
	                        &emsp;&emsp;The primary belief of Nilsonian thought is the idea of a merit-based, elective system of government. The first paragraph of Nilson’s book, states: “The State must be just, and in order for the State to be just, great justice must be exercised in electing a Leader”. Nilsonian thought requires a form of democracy, where the electorate comprises of citizens of the State. What set Nilsonian government apart from the democracies of the early-modern states of the 21st century of JC, was the meritocratic component of the government. Nilson believed the leader of the State must be elected solely on a meritocratic basis, without regard to external, “immoral”(as he described them in his book) factors. Nilson regarded many of the governments of the nations of Earth at his time to be corrupt, non-representative, and morally apprehensible.

	                        &emsp;&emsp;Although the genuine meritocracy of Edmund Nilson is a far cry from our current form of government, the basis of our modern Parliament and the Imperial Council are still rooted within his theories.

	                        <span class="subtitle">Part 2: The man behind Nilsonian government</span>
	                       	<br>
	                        &emsp;&emsp;Edmund Nilson was born within the borders of the Earth nation of the Republic of Canada, year 1999. His rather liberal upbringing resulted in young Nilson developing leftist political views and liberal morals. However, he was often exposed to right-wing influences, and many historians today, believe that this has contributed greatly to the development of his governmental theories. As a youth, Edmund was already interested in the world of politics, and followed world politics closely. 
	                        <br><br>
	                        &emsp;&emsp;Nilson went on to study at the Unified University of Canada (at the time only the University of Toronto) and acquired a bachelor's degree in Political Science. He then went on to study International Law and International Relations, obtaining Master's degrees in both. During his study, Nilson wrote in one of his reflection papers: 
	                        <br><br>
	                        <div class="quote">“The basis of my life is already known. I am a globalist, and I will work to unite the globe, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. We will be equal, equal in the eyes of the Law, which I so greatly believe in.“</div>
							<span class="quoteauthor">—Edmund Nilson, February Self-Reflection Journal</span>
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;His views at the time were certainly egalitarian in nature and promoted the various freedoms in which he believed. Edmund Nilson was known by his professors to be a very critical thinker. According to Dr. John E. Gann, professor of Political Science and Political Philosophy at the Edmund Nilson School of Politics, Nilson was “very critical of views that challenged his viewpoint, but very observant and keen to understand things from an alternate point of view”. Due to his diligence in study, Edmund received the Canadian Scholars Recognition Award, an award given to students demonstrating a high ability and merit. Edmund graduated ranked 19th in his class, with a GPA of 3.89. His name, along with the other top 50 students in his class, was engraved in a commemorative stone displayed to the public within the city itself. 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;After graduating from the University, Nilson began working on his career, a prestigious path within the field of International Relations. He moved to the UN Capital in Brussels to become an international delegate for the UN in 2029. Nilson was then recognized on an international level following the resolution of the Adriatic Conflict, known for his work in drafting the Dubrovnik Ceasefire treaty and aiding in the Marseilles Accord of 2035. Leaders from nations around Earth congratulated Nilson personally in a delegation meeting in Marseilles, French Republic, for a aiding in a non-military resolution to the conflict. Edmund Nilson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2036; however it was given out to the French diplomat who was the mediator in the Marseilles Accord. 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Nilson started the draft of “The Internal Systems of Government and Statecraft” in April, 2049. The first edition of the book was completed in January the following year, but was not published since Nilson did not feel that it was ready. He began work on a second edition, with a deeper explanation of his theory of government. The second edition was published in January 2052. The book was well received by political scientists and critics; however it drew criticism by members of the International Parliament. It seemed as if the government was opposed to Nilson’s revolutionary ideas, which were considered radical by many of its officials.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Fortunately for Nilson, for reasons that are not clear even today, the President of the UN received the book very well. Nilson was appointed the Minister of Internal Affairs of the UN, a position which he accepted gladly. Being the head of the ministry, Nilson had many extended powers within the UN’s administration and internal systems, giving him the power to exert his own influential ideas within the organization. Nilson’s reforms, which include the Fair Representation Act and the Candidate Naturalization Act, brought a change in the electoral system to better reflect pure democratic practices within the election process and changes based on his meritocratic ideals. These reforms have persisted today, and now form the basis of our current electoral and governing body.
							<br><br>
							<span class="subtitle">Part 3: Core Principles of Nilsonian Government</span>
							<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Nilson’s governmental theory requires three core principles to ensure its efficacy and proper function. First, an individual’s merit must be upheld as the highest standard of judgment. This judgement will form the basis of the genuine meritocracy that is the most recognizable and distinguishing feature of Nilsonian government. The system must also be an entirely direct democratic system, where citizens vote on issues themselves and thereby are represented solely by themselves. This second tenet of Nilson’s theory ensures the majority of citizens are able to enact decisions that will affect their nation. Finally, according to Nilsonian principles, the government must have the capability to redirect or delegate citizens when it is deemed necessary by the head of state, or approved by the parliament. Nilson believed the government should be able to intervene in a citizen’s life if it can be justified that the citizen would be of better use in another sector of society. 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;These three core principles work in conjunction to form the ideal government of Edmund Nilson. Following these three core principles leads a nation to acquire a Nilsonian-like government. With that being said, Nilson recommended more than simply adopting these principles. Nilson found many governments of his time to be unsatisfactory, even if they did possess and practice forms of these principles. Governments, according to Nilson, must not only adhere to these three principles, but they must also uphold them exclusively. When discussing the core principles of his theory, Nilson had written:
							<br><br>
							<div class="quote">
							“The State shall respect and uphold the three Core Principles: Merit, Democracy, and Direction… The State will ensure the Core Principles do not collude with each other, forming an undesirable ambiguity of morals… [These] Core Principles form the nation, and the Leader must utterly respect them.”
							</div>
							<span class="quoteauthor">—Edmund Nilson, The Internal Systems of Government and Statecraft, Chapter 2: The Core Principles</span>
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Nilson used the systems of governments of his own time as a basis for his revolutionary Nilsonian theory. Therefore, he attempted to fix what he considered to be the greatest problem, the corruptibility of governments. 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Nilson recognized the potential of corruptibility of the government and its ethics within his system. He referred to this phenomenon as a collusion of the core principles. He insists that the three tenets must be kept separate in order to reduce the ambiguity or liberal interpretation that could arise should the nation meddle with the core principles. Nilson defines collusion as “the situation that occurs when one ethic is supplanted by another, when one of the Core Principles is used to justify what should be in the domain of another Core Principle”. 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;The second chapter of "The Internal Systems of Government and Statecraft" contains various examples that Nilson himself observed to be the collusion of the Core Principles. Nilson was able to study governments of his time, and found that the ambiguousness of ethics was what he believed to be the primary cause of corruption. A case example that was often referred to in the book was that of the democratic republics of his time. In the past, these republics would resort to a type of democracy which was indirect, where the citizens vote on a member of parliament that would represent a specific political division within the nation. Nilson saw this as ambiguity between the principles of Democracy and Direction. Where the people were being directed by their representative, they were also the one to have elected that representative. According to Nilson, this situation would continue to develop corruption, as the representative would be seeking to be reelected in order to stay in power, therefore possibly turning to corruption as he seeks support from more powerful entities.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;&emsp;Since the corruption of governments of his own time influenced the views of Edmund Nilson greatly, his treatise on his ideal views of politics attempts to reduce corruption as much as possible. Some experts on political science and history, including Nilson’s former student, Dr. Koyoy Sidala, professor of History at the Edmund Nilson School of History, state Nilson’s “fervent anti-corruption ideology” to have been prominently displayed in “The Internal Systems of Government and Statecraft“. Prior to writing his book, Nilson had famously said in a diplomatic conference: “Clarity is the enemy of corruption”. This led to Nilson clearly defining the roles of each Core Principle of his government, and also the roles in which the head of state and its ministries play in the function of Nilsonian government.
