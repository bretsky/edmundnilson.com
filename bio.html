	                        &emsp;One cannot begin to understand Edmund’s great success in life without first understanding the moments that allowed him to become successful. Edmund’s ironclad principles were forged in the fiery blaze of his youth, tempered by heated debates against cold-hearted, greedy conservatives. Yet what was it about his childhood that made him different? What influences set him apart from the plethora of other young liberal intellectuals growing up in the 21st century? For that, we must delve deep into the Edmund’s roots: the experiences and ideas that molded him into the great leader he would become.

							&emsp;It was a chilly night in Kelowna, and the dim glow of the moon was blocked by the snow drifting down from the heavens. At 1:30 AM on the 6th of December 1999, snow wasn’t the only thing that fell from the heavens. While frost coated the ground, another Frost, Dr. Ruth Frost, gave birth, and at that fateful moment a great leader was born. Though most likely nobody knew it yet, this boy would grow up to be exceptional. All those present at the Kelowna General Hospital were unknowingly witnessing the birth of a legend; this boy would be the next Mahatma Gandhi, the Julius Caesar of the modern age. However, when he was born, it was with little fanfare. The world was still ignorant of the greatness in their midst.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;Edmund himself has said that the day he was born was the most important day of his life, and few 21st century historians would disagree. Though he entered the world as a “blubbering ball of baby,” he would rapidly develop into a wise, tough, and mature young man. The first experiences Edmund can recall take place at Glenmore Elementary, where he first attended school. Of note is the fact that this was a French Immersion school; Edmund’s negative childhood encounters with the language would prove to have a long-lasting effect on him, leading him to hate the language. He also harboured a mild disdain for the French people, whom he regarded as inferior due to their ill-conceived and convoluted tongue. A year later, while in first grade, Edmund’s short career as a human bumper car came to an end. As his first grade teacher objected, strangely, to an amalgamation of first graders colliding with each other in winter coats, this also marked Edmund’s first trip to the principal’s office; as his innocence was wiped away, the true Edmund was revealed. This would be the man who would have no fear of skirting the law to do what was right, whose quest for justice would lead him to live in legal grey areas. This event also exemplifies Edmund’s unforgiving nature. While he may forgive those that have wronged him and his people, he certainly does not forget; this is shown by the animosity still present towards the traitorous friend who escaped punishment that day.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;His fascination with European culture was only amplified by a family trip to Europe. In grade three he visited the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, then beacons of European civilisation. Although destined to fall, these nations inspired young Edmund with their history and arts. To this day, Edmund can recall his favourite moment: seeing the Vauban fortification in the French town of Lille.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;Edmund’s parents certainly played an essential role in Edmund’s development. Though he hailed from modest upper middle class beginnings, his parents, both history professors, instilled in him the importance of scholarly learning from a young age. As soon as he could read, and even before that, his parents recall his burning desire for knowledge. One can clearly see the influence Edmund received from his parents in his interests and his politics. The source of Edmund’s primary fascination, medieval European history, can be clearly traced to his parents, Dr. Ben Nilson and Dr. Ruth Frost, who both taught Medieval Europe at the University of British Columbia Okanagan, among many other historical subjects. In addition to educating him on historical subjects, his parents also guided him into the world of politics, a world he would change forever. Edmund grew to espouse his parents’ liberal ideas of freedom, democracy and social equality; eventually he would formulate his own political system based on these concepts, but at this point he merely promoted the traditional ideals of his parents. What is not so immediately apparent however, is how history and politics are deeply intertwined in Edmund’s personal philosophy.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;By studying history, Edmund became acquainted with various diverse cultures: this would profoundly change him as a leader and theoretician. By expanding his Eurocentric focus, he realised the immense value of diversity, which reinforced in him a vision of equality for all. This can be seen in his pro-immigration views, his quest for social justice, and his struggle for universal freedom. Edmund saw the great success of diverse countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, but he also saw the shortcomings of their incompetent leadership, which eventually led to their failure. Thus young Edmund was determined to return these countries to their former glory. In addition, due to his proud atheism, Edmund was immune to the anti-rationalist fanaticism that pervaded 21st century religion. For his logical, secular opinions he was praised across both religious and political borders. The Dalai Lama described him as a “latitudinarian of the most excellent caliber,” and Pope Julius V referred to him as “the greatest force of change the world has ever seen.” 
							<br><br>
							&emsp;While he was an idealist and a visionary, Edmund was also a practical man of politics. He considered democracy the premier form of government, and as a result, spent his youth honing his skills of debate and persuasion. In order to enact his policies, it was necessary for Edmund to convince others of their merit. As a child, Edmund was unfairly discriminated against by those possessing a chronological advantage over him, so he sought to convince the adults who silenced him that his ideas were far beyond his years. Later in life, when pitted against opposing opinions and violent extremists, Edmund always managed to stay more collected than his opponents, ensuring his victory. By swaying his rivals with logic and reason rather than emotional appeals, he earned the respect of his peers and even managed to inspire a revolutionary new technique of debate, the Nilsonian Theory of Conflict Resolution, which emphasises objectivism and rationalism as its core tenets.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;After traveling through his early education unmatched in both maturity and intellect, Edmund entered what he would come to describe as “the cesspool of humanity.” Surrounded by inferior students with “morally apprehensible philosophies and oppressively unjust ideologies,” a lesser man would be brought down to their level, would wallow in the filth of their pitiful existence. Not Edmund. Like a shining light in the darkness, a paragon of humanistic virtue, Edmund not only rose above his appalling surroundings, he reformed them. Leaving a trail of sanity in his wake, he shattered the cynical worldview of those who anticipated his failure.
